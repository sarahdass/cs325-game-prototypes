<h2>Feed the Cats!</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
I made the tile map and story. 
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
Uses game states, tilemap, audio, and random.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned how to use game states, put in audio, and get random numbers. 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
This game is sort of similar to a very simplified version of OverCooked. Started from a prototype. 
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Pick up the fish and bring it to a cat who wants it. 
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
It is a collector game.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
The input is keyboard and mouse. It uses randomness and collecting
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
This prototype is testing picking up objects and using it for something else. 
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Players should experience either the reward for giving the correct fish, or the wrath of giving the wrong fish.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
Players will use the arrows to control the girl. When she walks over a fish, she will hold it. When she walks to a cat she will give it to them. If the cat wants it it will stay and be happy, but if it doesn't you will lose points and it will leave. Giving the fish to a cat who wants it earns points. Scores decrease as time goes on. 
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Players should avoid areas where they can run into cats with the wrong fish.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
The girl has too many very needy cats. They are very picky eaters too. If she gives them the wrong fish, they will get mad and leave. 
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Anyone who likes to feed cats.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Less than a minute.
