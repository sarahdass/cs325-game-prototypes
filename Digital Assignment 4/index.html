<h2>Escape the Farm!!</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
The tile map is original, story is original, and puzzles are original. 
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
Physics such as gravity and drag are used. Has multiple stages, audio, and sprites. 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned how to add more levels to a game. Dealing with multiple levels and finding good assets was the hardest part. 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Rainbow Picture: self-made</li>
<li>Mountain Picture: self-made</li>
<li>Loading Rainbow: part of the template</li>
<li>Button: Phaser example (was edited) <a href="https://phaser.io/examples/v2/buttons/action-on-click">Action On Click</a></li>
<li>Chicken: <a href="https://opengameart.org/content/lpc-chicken-rework">chicken</a></li>
<li>Bridge Tile Set: <a href="https://opengameart.org/content/wood-bridge">bridge tile set</a></li>
<li>Wooden Crate: <a href="https://opengameart.org/content/simple-toon-wooden-crate-texture">crate</a></li>
<li>Blue star: <a href="https://opengameart.org/content/blue-star">star</a></li>
<li>Menu Music: <a href="https://opengameart.org/content/gone-fishin">menu music</a></li>
<li>Level One Music: <a href="https://opengameart.org/content/casual-game-track">lvl one music</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
<ul>
<li>This uses the game state template. Some of the code is borrowed from my previous games. 
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Players must manipulate their surroundings to escape. 
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
State which of the Storymatic themes you used.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
This is a plat-former game that uses the arrows to jump and move. 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Players should use the boxes around them to jump on areas they cannot reach. 
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
The player is a chicken who is trying to escape the farm after recently hearing that they are about to be dinner. 
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
How long does your game take to play?
</li>
