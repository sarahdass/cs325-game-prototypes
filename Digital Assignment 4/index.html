<h2>Escape the Farm!!</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
The tile map is original, story is original, and puzzles are original. 
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
Physics such as gravity and drag are used. Has multiple stages, audio, and sprites. 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned how to add more levels to a game. Dealing with multiple levels and finding good assets was the hardest part. 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>

</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
<ul>
<li>This uses one of the game state templates. Some of the code is borrowed from my previous games. 
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Players must manipulate their surroundings to escape. 
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
This is a puzzle plat-former game.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
This is a plat-former game that uses the arrows to jump and move. 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
This is evaluating level change and how to make each level more challenging and build off what the gamer learned from the previous level. 
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
The player should experience the challenge of trying figure out the best way to escape. 
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
Players will use the arrows to jump and move side to side. At level 1 players learn they can manipulate their environment to get out. Level 2, they realize that not all escape routes are as they seem.  
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Players should use the boxes around them to jump on areas they cannot reach. 
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
The player is a chicken who is trying to escape the farm after recently hearing that they are about to be dinner. 
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Anyone who likes trying to figure out how to get out places.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
It takes 1-3 minutes
</li>
