<h2>RainDrops</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
Characters (not the art), puzzles and maps are original. 
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
This game allows the player to interact with other sprites. They can push or pull the boxes.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned a way how to make the sprite pull boxes. 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
This game is be similar to indie platformer games such as GRIS. It is also very similar to my previous game.

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Players need to figure out how to get to the other side of the stage.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
State which of the Storymatic themes you used.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
This is prototyping different aspects of puzzle making. (such as difficulty and mechanics) 
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want the player to be able to solve the puzzle on their own, but not have it obvious to the point it is boring. 
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The player can jump and move side to side using the arrows. Some objects can be interacted with when the player bumps into it. 

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Players should try moving around and seeing what they can interact with to try to get to the other side. 
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
This story takes place in an enchanted forest. The main character is a girl who is searching for light magic infused raindrops to gain enough magic to heal her younger sister. 
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
The audience is anyone who likes puzzle games. 
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
First level takes less than a minute to play.
